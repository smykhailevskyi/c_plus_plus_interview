# 400 C++ interview questions

Last several years I have often been working on projects where I need to write a lot of C and C++ code. Also one of my activities is to take part in the interview process of the C and C++ developers as a technical interviewer. During the preparation for the interview I was faced with a list of 400 interview questions for C++ developers from Ukrainian site [**dou.ua**](https://dou.ua). You can read them [there](https://dou.ua/lenta/articles/interview-questions-c-developer/).

A lot of them are simple and I never use them in my real interview but this is the most complete list of the C++ technical questions I have ever seen. For this reason I have decided to translate them into English.
