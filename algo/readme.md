In this section I post the algorithm tasks which I was asked during the different interviews.\
I had 15-30 min for solving each task depending on the company.\
From my point of view for interview purpose you should solve a task from the **easy** level during 15 min, from the **medium** level - 15 - 30 min, the **hard** level - 20 - 45 min.
